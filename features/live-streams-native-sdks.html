<h3>Supported Features</h3>

<p>The live experience is enhanced with the following features supported with the Native SDKs:</p>

<h4>Out-of-the-box cloud DVR controls</h4>

<p>DVR Live goes above and beyond the classic approach to Live Streaming by allowing viewers to take control of their viewing experience. Providing the viewer full control over playback, DVR Live enables your audience to seek to past moments in a VOD styled setting. Then, with the click of a button, seamlessly jump back to the live action to continue watching in real time.</p>

<h4>Brightcove Live server-side ad insertion (SSAI)</h4>

<p>Server-side ad insertion (SSAI) allows you to stitch ads into your live stream on the server side, bypassing any ad blockers. For details about how to setup SSAI with your live streams, see the <a href="https://live.support.brightcove.com/live-api/ssai/live-api-server-side-ad-insertion-ssai.html">Brightcove Live API: Server-Side Ad Insertion</a> document.</p>
