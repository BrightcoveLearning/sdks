  <p>Multiple audio tracks allow you to provide additional information and reach a wider audience. Some examples include additional tracks for different languages, commentary, descriptive audio and stereo sound.</p>

<p>The SDKs automatically detect when a video has multiple audio tracks in the HLS or DASH manifest. If you are using the Brightcove default controls, you will see a unique list of audio tracks based on language and variant. There should be no duplicates.</p>

<p>While we work on bringing this feature to Video Cloud Studio, both Video Cloud and Brightcove Player customers need to supply their own manifests that follow HLS and DASH standards.</p>

<p>Once you create your content, you can load and play it just like any other video.</p>

<p>Here is the player with a video. If the video is prepared with multiple alternate audio tracks, a headphone icon will automatically appear in the control bar.</p>

<p>When the headphone icon is selected, a list of audio tracks will display for you to choose from.</p>
