<p id="playbackformats"><span><img alt="" height="20px" width="20px" src="/assets/images/getting-started/bcls-icon-mobile-app.png" />&nbsp;<strong>Playback Formats and Captions</strong></span></p>

<p>Staying on top of changing technologies is essential for providing the best playback experience to viewers. The Brightcove SDKs strive to support the most popular video and captions formats to ensure publishers are able to reach audiences around the world.</p>

<p id="advertising"><img alt="" height="20px" width="24px" src="/assets/images/getting-started/bcls-icon-money.png" />&nbsp;<strong>Advertising</strong></p>

<p>Through partnerships with some of the biggest names in online video advertising such as DoubleClick and FreeWheel, we provide plugins that integrate with the core Brightcove SDK in just a few lines of code.</p>

<p>In addition, the Brightcove Native SDKs support Brightcove Once, our industry-leading server-side ad insertion solution which delivers optimized video performance and prevents ad blocking technology.</p>

<p id="analytics"><img alt="" height="20px" width="20px" src="/assets/images/getting-started/bcls-icon-analytics.png" />&nbsp;<strong>Analytics</strong></p>

<p>As data consumers ourselves, we recognize that analytics are a powerful tool for understanding trends in your content. The Brightcove SDKs allow you to easily gather data whether you're a Video Cloud customer using Brightcove Analytics, a Brightcove Player customer using the analytics API's with your own backend, or some combination with a third-party integration such as Omniture.</p>

<p id="drm"><img alt="" height="20px" width="20px" src="/assets/images/getting-started/bcls-icon-security.png" />&nbsp;<strong>Digital Rights Management (DRM)</strong></p>

<p>We recognize that the security provided to video content using standards such as HLSe may not be enough to meet your strict protection requirements. DRM is a robust content protection program that enables you to enforce polices and rules for usage of your content.</p>

<p>The Brightcove SDKs enable you to integrate powerful DRM solutions and ensure the protection of your content without sacrificing the video experience your audience expects.</p>

<p id="media"><img alt="" height="20px" width="24px" src="/assets/images/getting-started/bcls-icon-mobilevideo.png" />&nbsp;<strong>Media Content</strong></p>

<p>As a Brightcove Video Cloud customer, you have access to your Brightcove content (videos, image assets and playlists) through the Playback API, CMS API or the Brightcove catalog. The catalog is a library of helper methods you can use to access your Video Cloud library.</p>

<p>The tools for accessing your content through the Playback/CMS APIs and the catalog are built into the foundation of the Brightcove Mobile SDKs.</p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Access to the Brightcove Playback/CMS APIs and Brightcove catalog are only available to Brightcove Video Cloud customers.</aside>
&nbsp;

<p id="live"><img alt="" height="20px" width="24px" src="/assets/images/getting-started/bcls-icon-camera.png" />&nbsp;<strong>Live Playback</strong></p>

<p>Tap into the benefits of live playback in your application with the Brightcove SDKs. Launch a live stream event to boost viewership and generate interest, or supply long form live content such as news feeds and sporting events to keep your viewers informed and entertained.</p>

<p>Enabling high quality playback of live streams, the Brightcove SDKs allow you to easily configure and play Live and DVR Live content.</p>

<p id="controls"><img alt="" height="20px" width="20px" src="/assets/images/getting-started/bcls-icon-ui.png" />&nbsp;<strong>Brightcove Native Player Controls</strong></p>

<p>Save developer costs, reduce time to market and keep your app clean of unnecessary code clutter. Included with our core iOS and Android player SDKs, the Brightcove Native Player Controls provide common user interface components to fit your player interface needs. Completely customizable, you can change sizes, colors, and even add or remove buttons to easily build a user interface that suits your application.</p>

<p id="360video"><img alt="" height="24px" width="30px" src="/assets/images/getting-started/bcls-360-icon.png" />&nbsp;<strong>360° Video</strong></p>

<p>Drive views with compelling 360° video experiences. The experience lets viewers immerse themselves into the scene and allows them to interact and explore by scrolling around the video. The Native SDKs automatically detect if your content is a 360° video type and plays it, while allowing the user to scroll around the view.</p>

&nbsp;

<p id="mat"><img alt="" height="20px" width="24px" src="/assets/images/getting-started/headphone-icon.svg" />&nbsp;<strong>Multiple Audio Tracks</strong></p>

<p>Reach a wider audience by including additional audio tracks for different languages, for commentary and descriptive audio, or provide stereo sound. When your video content has multiple audio tracks, the SDKs automatically detect them and displays a track selection menu.</p>

&nbsp;

<p id="odrm"><img alt="" height="20px" width="24px" src="/assets/images/getting-started/download-icon.svg" />&nbsp;<strong>Offline playback</strong></p>

<p>Simplifying the complexities around managing offline playback while also providing content security and analytics, the Brightcove Native SDKs provide the tools to build such apps. This means users can download their favorite videos before they travel and then play them back without an internet connection.</p>
