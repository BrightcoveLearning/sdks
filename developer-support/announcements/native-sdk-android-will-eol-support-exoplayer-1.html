<!-- UPDATE description -->

<p>Google continues to update the <a href="https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer">ExoPlayer</a> media player framework with the latest technology solutions. In order to focus on cutting edge features, we must evolve alongside Google by providing support for only the relevant version of the ExoPlayer.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/releases">ExoPlayer 1 release</a> was last updated on March 17, 2017. If you haven't already done so, we recommend transitioning to the ExoPlayer2 framework.</p>

<p>For details about how to migrate, see the <a href=" /android/framework/migrating-exoplayer-2-framework.html">Migrating to ExoPlayer 2 Framework</a> document.</p>
