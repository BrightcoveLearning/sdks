<p>If you use the Brightcove player and <code>catalog</code> included in the SDK to retrieve and play videos, analytics data will be automatically collected and will appear in the Video Cloud Analytics module.</p>

<p>If you override the <code>BrightcoveVideoView</code> class or do not use the Brightcove player and catalog, you need to send your Account Id to Video Cloud Analytics.</p>

<h2 id="Customize_properties">Customize properties</h2>

<p>As of version 4.2.7 of the Brightcove Mobile SDK for Android, you can send custom values to Brightcove Analytics from your app for Account Id, Destination URI and Source URI.</p>

<p>Your Account Id is required, but is automatically set when you use the Brightcove player and the <code>catalog</code>.</p>

<p>You can set the Destination and Source URIs if you choose. The default values are based on the application package name.</p>

<p>These properties can be set in your Android <code>MainActivity</code> class file:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-java">brightcoveVideoView = (SeamlessVideoView) findViewById(R.id.brightcove_video_view);

Analytics analytics = brightcoveVideoView.getAnalytics();
analytics.setAccount("<span class="bcls-input">your accountID</span>");
analytics.setDestination("<span class="bcls-input">valid URI</span>");
analytics.setSource("<span class="bcls-input">valid URI</span>");</code></pre>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h3 id="Account">Account</h3>

<p>Use the <code>account</code> property to set the Account Id value in Brightcove Analytics. This property will be useful only in cases where there is no <code>accountId</code> value in the video’s metadata (for example, if your app uses a mix of Video Cloud videos, which contain the <code>accountId</code> property, and non-Video Cloud videos, which will not contain the <code>accountId</code> property).</p>

<p>For example, you can set the accountId property as follows:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-java">brightcoveVideoView.getAnalytics().setAccount("<span class="bcls-input">your accountId</span>");</code></pre>

<p>When you set the account property, the value of this property will be used for any of your videos which do not already have an <code>accountId</code> property. The most useful value for this property is your own Account Id. These videos will be reported in the Analytics module as <strong>Other/Third Party</strong> since Brightcove Analytics does not currently support detailed reporting for videos that are not retrieved through the Brightcove Catalog service.</p>

<p>For Video Cloud videos, setting this account override has no effect on reporting, since the video's <code>accountId</code> metadata value remains unchanged. That value can not be overridden by setting this account value.</p>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h3 id="Destination">Destination</h3>

<p>Use the <code>destination</code> property to set the value of the location that originates the event. The value of the destination property MUST be in proper URI format, similar to this example:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-java">bcsdk://com.mhogben.source</code></pre>

<p>The default value the destination property is <code>bcsdk://</code> followed by the app name, followed by the package name.</p>

<p>For example, in the Android SDK HLS Sample App, the destination value would be:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-java">bcsdk://HLSSampleApp/com.brightcove.player.samples.hls.basic</code></pre>

<p>Any screen in your app that instantiates a <code>brightcoveVideoView</code> can set this destination override to a distinct value, to better track video views within the app itself.</p>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h3 id="Source">Source</h3>

<p>Use the <code>source</code> property to set the URI that sent the end-user to the destination URI. As with the destination value, the value of the source property MUST be in proper URI format, similar to this example:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-java">bcsdk://com.mhogben.source</code></pre>

<p>The default value of the source property is null. When the value is null, the source property is not sent to the Analytics server.</p>

<p>For example, you can set the source property as follows:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-java">brightcoveVideoView.getAnalytics().setSource("bcsdk://com.brightcove.HLSPlayerSampleAppSource");</code></pre>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: For more details about URI structures for use in the destination and source fields, see the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme">URI Scheme</a> Wikipedia page. You can use a tool like this <a href="https://www.url-encode-decode.com/">URL Encoder</a> to convert characters into UTF-8 encoding format.</p>

<h2 id="View_analytics"><a name="viewAnalytics"></a>View analytics</h2>

<p>In the Video Cloud Analytics module, you can view metric data at the account level or at a detailed level such as by video.To learn how, view the following docs:</p>

</ul>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: Brightcove Analytics converts the destination and source values you’ve set to an all lower-case string value in all reports.</p>
