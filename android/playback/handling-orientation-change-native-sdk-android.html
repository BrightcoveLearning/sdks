<p>By default when an orientation change occurs the current <code>Activity</code> is destroyed and recreated. When retrieving and playing a Brightcove video, this causes the catalog request to be performed again and the <code>BrightcoveVideoView</code> is recreated. This takes both time and bandwidth.</p>
<p>By adding code to the <strong>AndroidManifest.xml</strong> you can prevent this unwanted default behavior.</p>

<p>It's more efficient to handle the orientation change as a device configuration change. This keeps the <code>Activity</code> instantiated, and just the layout is invalidated. To do this, you can modify the <strong>AndroidManifest.xml</strong>.</p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">The device configuration is a set of characteristics that describe the current state of the device. The characteristics that make up the configuration include screen orientation, screen size, language and others.</aside>

<p>To make a device rotation a configuration change add the following code to the <code>&lt;activity&gt;</code> tag in the <strong>AndroidManifest.xml</strong>.</p>

<code class="language-java">android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize"</code></pre>
